## 📋 Implementation Notes

### Key Technical Requirements

1. **Real-Time Synchronization**: All flows require WebSocket connections with Supabase for instant updates
2. **State Management**: Complex state requires careful management of optimistic updates and conflict resolution
3. **Video Quality**: Adaptive streaming based on connection quality and participant count
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when features fail or connections are poor
5. **Performance**: Optimized for 100+ simultaneous participants

### Flow Integration Points

- **Mode Switches**: Critical synchronization points affecting all users
- **Exercise Assignments**: Multi-user targeting with personalization
- **Rep Counter Updates**: Real-time data flow to coach dashboard
- **Group Management**: Dynamic highlighting and performance tracking
- **Health Considerations**: Cross-feature safety system integration

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

- **AI Form Analysis**: Automated form correction alerts
- **Predictive Targeting**: ML-driven exercise recommendations
- **Advanced Analytics**: Deeper performance insights and trends
- **Social Features**: Enhanced peer interaction and motivation
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-optimized interface adaptations

This comprehensive flow documentation provides the complete picture of how FitWithPari operates from both coach and student perspectives, with full technical detail for implementation teams.
